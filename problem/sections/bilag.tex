\subsection{Mail med David fra IKEA Sverige}
Hi! Apart from hand sketching and physical prototypes, we use the 3D modeling application Solid Works in IKEA of Sweden. And for renderings we use either the built in renderer, or photo works, which is also part of solid works.

Regards

And so we would like to ask you if you use any software to visualize your design, before they are made as a prototype or finished product. If you use any software feel free to tell us so we could research the software and get a better insight in the industry. I really hope you can help us. Thanks
